 Batzpups Duelist of the roses Modding

Public version of my mods and patches for DOTR, maybe to be integrated into a modding tool in the future. 

Note this is for memory patching at run time. 
This is not really designed for public use yet,
but if you want to use it here are the instructions.

To use this you would need an Injector of your choice,

Steps to use:
Open pcsx2\n
Inject the dll\n
Load Duelist of the Roses\n
Wait for the Konami screen then press the home key to load the changes\n
Play the game\n
